# Diabetes-Prediction
The **Diabetes Prediction Model** is designed to assess diabetes risk using health data and logistic regression. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to provide accurate and insightful predictions. 

The process begins with **robust data preprocessing**, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature selection to ensure a high-quality dataset for model training. The logistic regression algorithm is employed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on key health parameters. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated through metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, ensuring its reliability and efficiency in prediction tasks.

The project also emphasizes **data visualization** to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset. Tools like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are used to create informative graphs, including correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and feature importance charts, enhancing interpretability. 

Developed using **Python** along with libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the model demonstrates the integration of programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning. This project highlights the potential of predictive models in healthcare, offering a practical solution for early diabetes detection and risk assessment. It showcases proficiency in machine learning and data analysis while contributing to impactful healthcare innovations.
